How to add more buttons:

1. Text
Open webServerOLED and find the void setup() section.
Add this template at the bottom of the section.

server.on("/replaceThis", [](){
    drawText("Custom Text");
    server.send(200, "text/html", homePage);
  });

"/replaceThis" is the command sent to the server. 
"Custom Text" is the custom message.
homePage is the html page served after the request has been made. 
A new page can be linked but must be created as a new .h file and
the line: 
#include "newPage.h"
must be added.
Note for creating HTML pages they must start with:
const char newPage[] PROGMEM = R"=====(
and end with:
)=====";

2. Image
Go to davidmcphee.ca/image2oled.html and create your image.
Take the output code and add it to the bitmaps.h file. The bitmap 
must start with:
#define IMGx {\
where x is the image number. 
Next go to the webServerOLED page and add this template after the #define
rows:
const unsigned char imgx [] PROGMEM = IMGx;
and find the void setup() section.
Add this template to the bottom:

server.on("/imgx", [](){
    display.clearDisplay();
    display.drawBitmap(0, 0, imgx, 128, 64, 1);
    display.display();
    delay(2000);
    server.send(200, "text/html", homePage);
  });
A custom returned page can be added same as in 1.
